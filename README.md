This is a simple example of a quick React app that's built using the amazing [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) bundler. 

This library alone has made it so easy and straightforward to get a development environment up and running for most frontend projects.

Very excited to see it grow.

### Instructions

1. Clone the repo
2. `yarn` to install all dependancies
3. `yarn start` to run the project
